# Creating Android Slices

Slices are a new way to embed your app content in other surfaces. 
Slices are supported via a flexible templating system

Their templated content allow slices to feel at home in whatever surface
hosts them, but their dynamic nature aims to be much more rich and 
updatable than existing APIs.

This codelab will guide you through creating a simple app that supports
slices.
